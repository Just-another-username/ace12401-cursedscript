Nicknames and Titles
While you wear the curse, other people in the club may give you, themselves or anyone else a nickname and / or a title, when this happens it will be displayed on your screen and appear in chat and actions. Nicknames and titles only appear on your screen, not everyone else’s.

Who can do what will depend on how you have the curse set up but it’s pretty simple overall and works like this:

Anyone except the wearer can set, remove titles / nicknames from themselves or block having their name changed altogether

Owners and Mistress’ can change how you see other member’s names too, including your own.

Subs with the curse cannot change their own title or nickname but can give them to anyone that doesn’t already have one yet, they cannot change someone’s title/nickname or delete them either.

If you use the OwnerHub mode, other people cannot touch you but you can still give titles and nicknames to anyone, including yourself.

Respect / Enforced

Last bit to note is that you can be given respect protocols for a member, this means must kneel when that person is in the same room and instead of calling someone by their usual name, you must call them by their nickname and use their title if they have one, this is the name you can see in the chatroom where their name used to be.  If you want to see a list of everyone who has enforced respect protocols then you can use the report command #name showenforced
