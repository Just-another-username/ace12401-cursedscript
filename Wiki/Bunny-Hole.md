I've decided to invite those courageous enough to wear the curse into my bunny hole. You can find the invitation in the main hall.

In there, you can find information, toggle intense mode, wear the curse for the first time or even ask for some examples of what can be done!

Careful though, if I put a curse on you, you'll have to find someone to turn things around.

I might feature more things in this room depending on where things go. For now, the two main things it adds is the ability to reset the curse and some examples.
