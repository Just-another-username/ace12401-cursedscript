Update Info
The way nicknames and titles has changed, between having multiple titles and not displaying them onscreen there was some confusion over the old system so it's been stripped back and rebuilt from scratch to be a bit more user friendly.  For a start there’s now only 1 title per person so those that only used the default titles in the previous versions of the curse will notice that enforced characters now have the title “Owner”, this is because only the last given nickname is carried over when you change over to the new version, I did it this way is so that people don’t lose custom titles.  If you’d prefer a different default transferred over, there’s a 1-time command that will fix that for you (#name changedefaulttitle [title]).
