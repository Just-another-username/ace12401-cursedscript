### The curse works only in certain parts of the club on purpose.
###  There are also a few different permission layers to the curse to help customize it to your needs. Each term is explained below.

## Activation

**Chatrooms**: Everything goes! "Curse" whispers are messages only you can see. Commands MUST be whispered

**Outside Chatrooms**: Your messages will be saved until you hop into a room. Curses will not be applied so nothing is restrained outside of rooms

**LARP rooms**: none of the curse's function will work inside LARP rooms. EVER.

## Modes
**Normal version**: This version does not contain anything that can restrain your accessibility to certain features. It will also never contain anything that modifies any of the data the club uses. Therefore, it is deemed safe for use as you will always have control if something goes wrong.

**Intense version**: This version contains "riskier" features. These include things that would block certain features like the maids, breaking one's collar, etc. If intense mode is turned off, not even the wearer's owner can do anything about it. I recommend only selecting members you trust as your owners if you are to use this version.


## Permissions
**In-game blacklist/ghostlist**: anyone in your actual ghost list or blacklist will not be able to interact with your curse. They will also not be able to be given a nickname.

**Curse blacklist**: This blacklist is specific to the curse. It will not stop  someone from interacting with you, but they won't be able to send commands to your curse anymore. They will not be able to be given nicknames

**Enforced**: When someone is enforced, their name will be checked and must be said with a proper title before end. This feature will soon be reworked. Be careful about names that are common such as Alice, Sarah, etc.

**Public**: Anyone besides the wearer. This level of access can be disabled by a mistress or an owner. See the page about functions for more details.

**Public (All-time)**: Anyone besides the wearer, active at all time. These are mostly utilities like the help or block nickname commands that always need to be available

**Mistresses**: They have power over the wearer and can activate various curses. They are one step below owners and have less "configuration" options for the wearer. See the page about functions for more details. An owner can turn mistress functions into public functions.

**Owners**: They have full power over the wearer's curse. The only functions they do not have access to are the wearer functions and the club owner functions. See the page about functions for more details.

**Club owner**: Only one person can fall into this category, the wearer's in-club owner. They have access to every function except wearer functions.

**Private**: This level of permission includes the cursed one, aka the one running the script and the curse owners. 

**Wearer**: The cursed one, aka the one running the script. They are restrained to their own few set of commands which are almost all configurations or reports. See the page about functions for more details.
